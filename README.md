# gce-purge-snapshots

## What is it?

A command-line tool that lets you purge (delete) Google Compute 
Engine snapshots according to rules you set up. 

For example, 

    ./gce-purge-snapshots -v all -h 48 -d 14 -w 4 -m 24

means "keep every snapshot on all volumes for 48 hours, one 
per day for two weeks, one per week for four weeks, one per 
month for two years - delete everything else".

The idea is that you have another job which takes a snapshot, 
say, every hour, then run this script periodically to clean up.

## Usage

    Usage: ./gce-purge-snapshots [options]

    Deletes ALL snapshots (for the volumes specified) that do not
    match the rules below. Rules are applied in the following order:

        -t, --tag KEY=VALUE              Tag to use to filter the snapshot. May specify multiple tags.
